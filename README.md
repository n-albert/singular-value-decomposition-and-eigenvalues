# singular-value-decomposition-and-eigenvalues
This is a Python solution for an interview question in regards to singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigenvalues of initialized tensors.

The posed question was:
In a Python file, write a PyTorch program to create a 2-dimensional tensor of size 5x5, initialized with random values between -1 and 1. Be sure to set the torch seed to 0.

Next, compute this tensor's singular value decomposition (SVD) using the torch.svd() function and square each of the singular values to compute the eigenvalues of the original tensor and print it. Finally, convert the eigenvalues to a Python list and print it.
